Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a list of five-letter words. One of them will be randomly chosen to be the word guessed in the game. I have started the while loop for my game. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't finished the code for the game yet, but I know I'm using a while loop until the user guesses the word. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I'm unsure of how I want to indicate that the letters are wrong. I want to use color, but I'm not exactly certain how to do this yet.
